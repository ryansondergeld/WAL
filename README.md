# Winners And Losers

## How To Play
- There will be a string of 5-50 random 'L' and 'W' letters created when the game starts
- Each player takes turns removing one letter from the left of the string or the right of the string
- The game continues until the last letter is removed
- If the last letter is a 'W' the player who takes it wins
- If the last letter is a 'L' the player who takes it loses

## Definitions

For the remainder of this readme, the following will be used:
- 1P will refer to the player who takes the first turn
- 2P will refer to the player who takes the last turn

## CPU Theory
In any given game, the length of the string will determine which player has the last turn.
- If the string is even, the second player (2P) will pull the last tile
- If the string is odd, the first player (1P) will pull the last tile

Because of this condition, it is most important to look at who will take the penultimate turn (next-to-last). This player in this particular position decides the entire game.  Since there are only two letters at this point we have a simple truth table we can create:

- A represents the letter to the left
- B represents the letter to the right
- Q represents the letter than 1P picks
- Winner represents who will win the game

| | |Q|Winner|
|-|-|-|------|
|L|L|L|1P    |
|L|W|L|1P    |
|W|L|L|1P    |
|W|W|L|1P    |

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
